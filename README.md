# Computer-Graphics
This is a repo for all of my assignments completed in CS3451 @ Georgia Tech.
  
These were done using TypeScript, Three.js, and other libraries while some assignments are done with no external libraries.  
  
## To Run:  
First, `cd` into the assignment folder and run `npm install`.  
Wait for the node modules to install and then run `npm run dev`.  
For individual run instructions and requirements (some not met) see the individual assignment `readme`.  
  
Thanks!
